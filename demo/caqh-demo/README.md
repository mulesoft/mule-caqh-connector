    <artifactId>mule-caqh-connector</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```
1. Add the configuration values in configuration.yaml located at src/main/resources.
2. Check if globalConfiguration.xml has picked the properties by clicking on Test Connection.
3. Open one of the mule configuration files and run the project.
4. Once the project gets deployed successfully, hit the endpoints mentioned in listener path from any rest client. 
5. For all the localhost endpoints and valid payload values please import the "CAQH-Localhost-postman_collection.json" file in postman client.

Note: For TLS configurations you should have keystore.jks in src/main/resources directory, already packaged with the demo
